<h4>Crossover Filters: Only Fandoms</h4>

<p>
  Using the "Only Fandoms" field AND having "Show Only Crossovers" will filter out all works that don't only belong to the inputted fandoms.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if you want to filter works for the Blue Lock (Manga) fandom and you want Blue Lock (Anime) and Free! crossovers only, just insert them into "Only Fandoms" and select "Show Only crossovers". This will hide all works that are not in these fandoms or belong to other fandoms.
